# SaveOurSoul
## Sos app alert


It is impossible to predict in advance what situation you might find yourself in. The incident with the Citymobil taxi driver, the Harvey Weinstein case, the stories under the hashtag #MeToo, etc. are horrific and unacceptable cases. So I asked myself: "How can you secure yourself in advance?"

## Solution Description:

SOS ("Save Our Souls" or "Save Our Ships") was primarily used as the International Morse Code Distress Call. Now the term is used in a more general sense when it is necessary to send a notification of a situation requiring immediate attention.

## Message
In our application, users will be able to send multiple text messages with one click of a button. Phone numbers and text message content can be configured from within the application. The message text sent by the user also contains the last known location of the user and is displayed with Link in GoogleMaps.

In addition, the user can allow the application to track his location. If permissions are granted, the app retrieves the device's location approximately every 15 minutes and stores it in a database.

##  New stuff is voice dialog builder
There are records for simulating telephone conversations. In our application there are recordings of dialogues intended not only for girls, but also for young boys.

Each cell has a classification of the situation for which the dialogue is intended: street or taxi. Clicking on a cell opens the recording and the text of the conversation, which you can expand and use the ScrollBar to scroll up and down. To start playing the recording, click on the Play button icon. When you click, the Play icon is replaced by the Stop icon, by pressing it again you can stop the audio playback.
